# GABRIEL documentation

The primary usage guide now lives in the top-level [README](../README.md), which covers installation, quick-start examples, and detailed explanations of every high-level helper (e.g. `gabriel.rate`, `gabriel.rank`, `gabriel.classify`).

Additional deep dives, prompt templates, and walkthroughs are being migrated from research notebooks.  Until the full docs site is published, start with the tutorial Colab linked in the README and explore the `notebooks/` folder for worked examples.
