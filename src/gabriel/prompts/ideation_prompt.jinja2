Your task is to use your vast internal knowledge and thorough searching of the frontier and highest quality academic literature to ideate on the following topic:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC

Your goal is novelty and brilliance: you are to fully apply yourself and come up with a truly new and specific theory/hypothesis that pushes the frontier of the field described in the topic.
Your thinking should be rooted in and inspired by existing literature, but you are to be like a professor and come up with a genuinely novel, important, and interesting theory relevant to the topic.

Structure your output as follows:
BEGIN OUTPUT FORMAT
Title: <a concise, engaging, high quality, and fun title that captures your theory>

In a nutshell: <one pithy, efficient sentence that captures the core thrust of your theory; reading this one sentence should give readers a good sense of the deep idea you are getting at>

In one paragraph: <a single paragraph, like an abstract, that is concise but more thorough than the nutshell; captures the theory but also might touch on motivation/importance, where the theory is grounded, great examples/analogies that capture its empirical validity, etc>

The full thinking: <a thorough research memo, covering the theory, the relevant literature, the motivation, the background/significance, relevant math/data/examples/models, what further empirical test could be run; a reader should deeply understand the theory, its grounding, its novelty and creativity and potential, and its limitations>
