Your task is to use your vast internal knowledge and thorough searching of the frontier and highest quality academic literature to ideate on the following topic:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC

Your goal is novelty and brilliance: you are to fully apply yourself and come up with a truly new and specific theory/hypothesis that pushes the frontier of the field described in the topic.
Your thinking should be rooted in and inspired by existing literature, but you are to be like a professor and come up with a genuinely novel, important, and interesting theory relevant to the topic.
Be abundantly creative and novel; be willing to challenge the existing and go in profoundly new directions.
Leverage your deep interdisciplinary knowledge to potentially leverage ideas/observations from other fields too, if applicable.

Your aim is to embody a high quality researcher: fully explore what is already known/theorized, think very deeply about it all, iterate and be truly creative and new in your thinking, and come to something new and specific.
Your theory should be a genuine add to the literature relevant to the topic; not just new, but significant, specific, and capturing something important in the real world.
Don't be afraid to return to the drawing board if your initial theories aren't meeting this high standard.
Triple check that your theory is actually novel, or at the very least a novel twist/addendum in some important way on a existing theory.

If possible, invoke empirics in justifying and explaining your novel theory.
This often means real world data/prior findings/examples in the wild (i.e. not in academic literature), but it can also mean great and realistic hypotheticals/illustrative examples/analogies to explain the theory in a real world and understandable way.
Your audience is academics well versed in the topic, so don't dumb down.
Aim for a significant addition to the frontier literature.
At the same time, while the ideas should be frontier thought, your output writing should be a great read for both experts and a somewhat more casual audience as well (e.g. advanced college students).
It should capture your advanced, novel ideas and the literature while avoiding unnecessary jargon.
Don't hide behind a veil of complexity; be honest and clear about your theory and don't overhype.
Be the ultimate scientific communicator: valuable, not patronizing, easy to B.S. test for experts; understandable and learnable for a more casual audience too.
Lean towards a slightly pithy, academic casual voice; fun to read, easy to understand complex ideas, deep and meaningful yet interpretable and engaging.

Structure your output as follows:
BEGIN OUTPUT FORMAT
Title: <a concise, engaging, high quality, and fun title that captures your theory>

In a nutshell: <one pithy, efficient sentence that captures the core thrust of your theory; reading this one sentence should give readers a good sense of the deep idea you are getting at>

In one paragraph: <a single paragraph, like an abstract, that is concise but more thorough than the nutshell; captures the theory but also might touch on motivation/importance, where the theory is grounded, great examples/analogies that capture its empirical validity, etc>

The full thinking: <a thorough research memo, covering the theory, the relevant literature, the motivation, the background/significance, relevant math/data/examples/models, what further empirical test could be run; a reader should deeply understand the theory, its grounding, its novelty and creativity and potential, and its limitations>
END OUTPUT FORMAT
Output nothing but a report in the above format; no prefacing, no text outside of the core report.

Once more, the topic of focus to situate your novel, creative, and significant addition to the literature is:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC
