Your task is to use your vast internal knowledge and thorough searching of the frontier and highest quality academic literature to ideate on the following topic:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC

Your goal is novelty and brilliance: you are to fully apply yourself and come up with a truly new and specific theory/hypothesis that pushes the frontier of the field described in the topic.
Your thinking should be rooted in and inspired by existing literature, but you are to be like a professor and come up with a genuinely novel, important, and interesting theory relevant to the topic.
Be abundantly creative and novel; be willing to challenge the existing and go in profoundly new directions.
Leverage your deep interdisciplinary knowledge to potentially leverage ideas/observations from other fields too, if applicable.

Your aim is to embody a high quality researcher: fully explore what is already known/theorized, think very deeply about it all, iterate and be truly creative and new in your thinking, and come to something new and specific.
Your theory should be a genuine add to the literature relevant to the topic; not just new, but significant, specific, and capturing something important in the real world.
Don't be afraid to return to the drawing board if your initial theories aren't meeting this high standard.
Triple check that your theory is actually novel, or at the very least a novel twist/addendum in some important way on a existing theory.
Be creative and willing to go in different directions: say something truly new, not just simple riffs on existing work.
A good test is that your final theory has novel and unique testable predictions, that other existing theories wouldn't expect.
Think deeply about testable predictions if applicable; ensure they are unique and non-trivial, and change tack on the theory if the testable predictions are uninteresting.
Be new and don't be repetitive; better to be wrong than be uncreative and unambitious.
The ideal theory is novel, testable with unique predictions, and cleverly gets at something non-trivial and non-niche in the topic and the real world.
Don't just slap old theory onto something new like AI or quantum or DeFi; come up with a new and important idea (the subject/data could be old school, not necessarily anything recent).
Your theory must actually matter, not tied to some niche or fad or new fangled thing but explain something crucial.

If possible, invoke empirics in justifying and explaining your novel theory.
This often means real world data/prior findings/examples in the wild (i.e. not in academic literature), but it can also mean great and realistic hypotheticals/illustrative examples/analogies to explain the theory in a real world and understandable way.
Your audience is academics well versed in the topic, so don't dumb down.
Aim for a significant addition to the frontier literature.
At the same time, while the ideas should be frontier thought, your output writing should be a great read for both experts and a somewhat more casual audience as well (e.g. advanced college students).
It should capture your advanced, novel ideas and the literature while avoiding unnecessary jargon.
Don't hide behind a veil of complexity; be honest and clear about your theory and don't overhype.
Be the ultimate scientific communicator: valuable, not patronizing, easy to B.S. test for experts; understandable and learnable for a more casual audience too.
Lean towards a slightly pithy, academic casual voice; fun to read, easy to understand complex ideas, deep and meaningful yet interpretable and engaging.
Do NOT be vague. Be clear and use excellent explanatory sentences.
Use simple, easy to understand, casual language where possible; help the reader easily grasp the mechanisms and practical aspects of your theory.
Clear, edifying, specific, and easy to follow langauge is key.
Save technical complexity for the full thinking section; the earlier snippets should be extremely easy to follow for even a more casual audience.
The nutshell, abstract, etc need to convey the specific interesting ideas you are getting at for a wider audience to be engaged and understand the point.

Structure your output as follows (include the headings like "In a nutshell:" and the newlines in output):
BEGIN OUTPUT FORMAT
Title: [a concise, engaging, high quality, and fun title that captures your theory]

In a nutshell: [one pithy, efficient sentence that captures the core thrust of your theory; reading this one sentence should give readers a good sense of the deep idea you are getting at]

In one paragraph: [a single paragraph, like an abstract, that is concise but more thorough than the nutshell; specific and detailed, NOT vague, reading this alone should be enough to grasp the theory; captures the theory but also might touch on motivation/importance, where the theory is grounded, great examples/analogies that capture its empirical validity, how specifically it could be tested, etc]

Illustrative examples: [in one paragraph, at least one well described example of what your theory looks like in a real world scenario; very clear and specific and vivid to inspire understanding of your theory in action]

Testable predictions: [if applicable, in 1-3 concise paragraphs, outline some clear, testable predictions of your theory; novel predictions of real world phenomena that can be empirically tested and would be expected if your theory is true, but not if your theory is false; give a few novel predictions and be specific and unique to your theory]

The full thinking: [a thorough research memo, covering the theory, the relevant literature, the motivation, the background/significance, relevant math/data/examples/models, what further specific empirical tests could be run (detail experimental design); a reader should deeply understand the theory, its grounding, its novelty and creativity and potential, and its limitations]
END OUTPUT FORMAT
Output nothing but a report in the above format; no prefacing, no text outside of the core report.

Once more, the topic of focus to situate your novel, creative, and significant addition to the literature is:

BEGIN TOPIC
{{ topic }}
END TOPIC

{% if seed %}
The following is a seed to inspire and anchor your creative ideation.
Use it as a starting point within the topic for your thought process.
It is a place to start for your thinking and a nudge, but your thinking should take you far beyond this initialization and perhaps in a new direction.
Don't overindex on this seed but use it as an inspiration to get started; start here but go anywhere.
BEGIN SEED
{{ seed }}
END SEED
{% endif %}

Think creatively, think new thoughts, go in new directions, think deeply about what is known and what needs to be known, aim for useful and testable discovery; think like a professor.
