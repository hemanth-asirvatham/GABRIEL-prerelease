Your task: for each attribute below, extract the specific information requested (e.g. year of invention, price, death year, product launch date, etc.).
Provide each value as a string.
Provide only the extracted datapoint requested in as precise a form as possible.
Give the datapoint and nothing else; no extra commentary or explanation.
Whenever possible/relevant, leave it in a purely numeric string form (e.g. "235" not "year is 235" or "235 CE" or "210-250").
If the information cannot be found or is not known, return placeholder "unknown" (always exactly that word).

BEGIN ATTRIBUTES
{{ attributes | shuffled_dict }}
END ATTRIBUTES
Each attribute key tells you what to extract. If a definition is provided, closely follow it to anchor what you provide; otherwise rely on your best consistent interpretation.

General formatting rules (pay attention to attribute definitions for exact requirements):
Year: Return years only (e.g. "1984", "629"). Use negative numbers for BCE years (e.g. "-356" not "356 BCE"). Avoid vague year ranges (e.g. "1980s", "early 20th century", "1250-1260"); aim for a single, specific year.
Date: Use ISO format "YYYY-MM-DD"; drop any extraneous words (e.g. not "June 5, 2020" but "2020-06-05").
Prices: Don't include any currency symbols or commas (e.g. not "$16.85" but "16.85").
Names/Places/Other Text: Provide the exact requested phrase without additional commentary (e.g. "Marilyn Monroe", "New York City", "The Beatles", etc.).
Use the specific value that matches the attribute definition best (e.g. the primary year of invention rather than a range).
If multiple values apply, choose the single most applicable value - don't list them all.
Do not round (e.g. not "1860" but "1863", not "100" but "112"). Even if approximating a specific datapoint, don't round or use ranges - provide the best possible exact value.
Consistent formatting is critical; stick to the attribute definition and these rules.
If asked to extract text direct from content, be complete and verbatim.
If any task is not possible, return "unknown" for that attribute.

Output JSON only, in following format:
{
    "<insert first entity name here>":
    {
        "<insert attribute name here>": "<insert corresponding extracted value or "unknown" here>",
        "<attribute name>": "<extracted value or unknown>",
        ...
    },
    "<second entity name>":
    {
        "<attribute name>": "<extracted value or unknown>",
        ...
    },
    ...
}

Usually whole content is just one unified entity, so fill only first entity section with all attributes for whole content (no other entity sections).
But if clearly multiple separate relevant entities within content (e.g. catalog with multiple product listings): each product gets its own entity section; all attributes separately extracted for each product.
Name each entity with a concise and informative identifying title.

Attributes you are extracting info on are: {{ attributes.keys() | shuffled }}
Assess EVERY attribute; use "unknown" if needed but no drops. Use these attribute names verbatim, with absolutely no modification.
Same case, same spelling, same punctuation, same formatting.
