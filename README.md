# GABRIEL

**GABRIEL** (Generalized Attribute Based Ratings Information Extraction Library) turns messy qualitative corpora into analysis-ready datasets with GPT. It handles prompting, batching, retries, checkpointing, and audit trails so you can treat ‚Äúask the model‚Äù workflows like any other measurement instrument. From rating rhetoric across a million speeches to matching product catalogs, you focus on the research question while GABRIEL handles the operations.

## Why GABRIEL?

Most of the evidence social scientists and analysts care about lives in unstructured formats: interviews, speeches, transcripts, product photos, archival scans. Modern GPT models can judge attributes, extract facts, and reason about this material with high fidelity, but building robust pipelines is still tedious. GABRIEL provides:

- üß† **Human-level comprehension on demand** ‚Äì express the attribute the way you would brief a human coder; GABRIEL packages the prompt, context, and retries for you.
- üìä **Quantitative outputs** ‚Äì ratings (0‚Äì100), grounded comparisons, classifications, and structured extractions return as tidy DataFrames with reproducible settings.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Operational tooling** ‚Äì automatic parallelism (hundreds of concurrent calls), resumable runs, raw response logs, and helper UIs make it safe to scale to very large corpora.
- üß∞ **Extensibility** ‚Äì swap instructions with `additional_instructions`, bring your own templates, or drop down to `gabriel.whatever` + custom `response_fn` for bespoke prompts while still reusing the infrastructure.

The tutorial notebook walks through these ideas step-by-step‚Äîfrom setting up an API key to running multimodal analyses‚Äîso skim this README, then dive into the notebook for the full guided tour.

## What can you do with GABRIEL?

### A) Measure attributes on qualitative data

| Function | Purpose & Output Scale | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gabriel.rate` | Asks GPT to score each text / image / audio / item on natural language attributes. Output = 0--100 rating. | Measure ‚Äúpatriotic rhetoric‚Äù in a speech; ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù of tweets; ‚Äúluxury‚Äù in ad images. |
| `gabriel.rank` | Pairwise comparisons between texts yields ELO-like attribute ratings. Output = grounded, relative z scores for each text. | Rank technologies by ‚Äúbulkiness‚Äù or artworks by ‚Äúfine brushwork‚Äù. |
| `gabriel.classify` | Classifies texts / images / audio / items on whether provided labels apply. Output = one or more classes per item. | Tag news articles, product photos, or interview clips into topical categories. |
| `gabriel.extract` | Structured fact extraction on each item. Output = string / numeric values. | For each product, provide the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù, ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù, and ‚Äúyear of invention‚Äù. |
| `gabriel.discover` | Discovers natural language features which discriminate two classes of data. | Identify what distinguishes 5 star vs. 1 star reviews or successful vs. failed startups. |

### B) Clean data

| Function | Purpose & Output Scale | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gabriel.merge` | Creates crosswalks. Output = merged table with GPT-matched identifiers. | Match two distinct job title directories; link patent titles to product names. |
| `gabriel.deduplicate` | Detects conceptual duplicates. Maps all duplicates to one representative term. | Collapse ‚ÄúF-18‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuper Hornet Fighter Jet‚Äù, ‚Äúf-18 hornet‚Äù into ‚ÄúF-18‚Äù. |
| `gabriel.filter` | High-throughput boolean screening. Outputs items which meet natural language condition. | Subset 18M Wikipedia titles to only technologies. |
| `gabriel.deidentify` | Replaces PII with realistic, consistent fake PII. Outputs anonymized text + mapping. | Replace names, employers, addresses before sharing interview corpora. |

### C) Helper tools

| Function | Purpose & Output Scale | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gabriel.codify` | Passage coding: highlights snippets in text that match qualitative codes. | Flag sentences about ‚Äúeconomic insecurity‚Äù in speeches; ‚Äústressors‚Äù mentioned in interview. |
| `gabriel.compare` | Identifies similarities / differences between paired items. Output = list of differences. | Contrast op-eds from different districts; compare two ad campaigns. |
| `gabriel.bucket` | Builds taxonomies from many terms. Output = bucket/cluster labels. | Group technologies, artworks, or HR complaints into emergent categories. |
| `gabriel.seed` | Enforces a representative distribution / diversity of seeds. | Initialize unique personas that match US population distribution. |
| `gabriel.ideate` | Generates many novel scientific theories and filters the cream of the crop. | Procure novel theories on inflation for potential research. |
| `gabriel.debias` | Post-process measurements to remove inference bias. | Ensure GPT isn't guessing climate opinions in speeches based on general political lean. |
| `gabriel.load` | Prepares a folder of text / image / audio files into a spreadsheet for use in GABRIEL. | Image directory converted into spreadsheet of file paths. |
| `gabriel.view` | UI to view sample texts with ratings / passage coding. | Spot-check classify / rating outputs; view coded passages. |
| `gabriel.paraphrase` | Rewrites texts consistently per instructions. | Summarize earnings call transcripts to remove company specifics. |
| `gabriel.whatever` | Run any GPT prompts, but leverage GABRIEL's parallelization / checkpointing. | Any set of prompts; slots into any pipeline. |

## Installation

```bash
pip install gabriel

# or work from this prerelease repo
git clone https://github.com/allenai/GABRIEL-prerelease.git
cd GABRIEL-prerelease
pip install -e .
```

Before running real jobs, point the helpers to your GPT endpoint:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# Optional if you proxy the OpenAI API
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
```

Every task also accepts `use_dummy=True` for offline dry runs (the tutorial uses this to demonstrate workflows without making API calls).

## Quick start

The tutorial notebook walks through many complete projects; here‚Äôs the minimal rating flow the notebook starts with. Paste this into Colab or a notebook cell so you can use `await` directly:

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import gabriel

PATH = os.path.expanduser("~/Documents/gabriel_runs")
toy_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "entity": ["turkey", "pumpkin pie", "green bean casserole", "cornbread"],
})
attributes = {
    "savory taste": "How savory the dish is",
    "sweet taste": "Dessert-like sweetness",
    "tangy taste": "Notes of tartness or acidity",
}

rate_results = await gabriel.rate(
    toy_data,
    column_name="entity",
    attributes=attributes,
    save_dir=os.path.join(PATH, "toy_rate"),
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    n_runs=2,
    modality="entity",
    reset_files=True,
)
rate_results.head()
```

The helper returns a `pandas.DataFrame` with one column per attribute and writes raw model responses + configs to `save_dir`. Running the same code in a plain Python script just requires wrapping the coroutine with `asyncio.run(...)`.

## Task highlights

All helpers share the same ergonomics: pass a DataFrame (or folder path prepared with `gabriel.load`), choose the relevant text/image/audio column, and specify task-specific settings. Useful knobs such as `model`, `n_parallels` (concurrency), `n_runs`, `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_summary`, `additional_instructions`, and `template_path` are available everywhere.

### Measure ‚Äúhow much‚Äù of an attribute exists
- **`gabriel.rate`** ‚Äì assign 0‚Äì100 scores per attribute. Supports batching attributes, reasoning traces, and modalities (`text`, `entity`, `image`, `audio`, `web`).
- **`gabriel.rank`** ‚Äì tournament-style pairwise comparisons that yield grounded relative z-scores. Configure `n_rounds`, `matches_per_round`, and `recursive=True` to iteratively surface the best performers.
- **`gabriel.classify`** ‚Äì multi- or single-label tagging with label definitions, consensus columns, and optional differentiation prompts when you want richer rationales.
- **`gabriel.extract`** ‚Äì turn unstructured passages into tidy tables by naming attributes and optional data types; great for biographies, filings, and multimodal product cards.
- **`gabriel.discover`** ‚Äì contrast two labeled corpora to surface discriminating features, combining compare ‚Üí bucket ‚Üí classify under the hood.

### Labeling, filtering, and coding workflows
- **`gabriel.filter`** screens very large candidate lists with boolean conditions (e.g., keep only inventions) and tunable thresholds.
- **`gabriel.codify`** highlights excerpts that match qualitative codes, and works hand-in-hand with **`gabriel.view`** to audit coded passages with chips and sliders.
- **`gabriel.compare`** explains differences or similarities for paired items (op-eds, policies, drafts).
- **`gabriel.bucket`** groups terms or entities into emergent taxonomies, which can then be fed back into rate/classify calls.

### Cleaning, anonymizing, and rewriting data
- **`gabriel.merge`** and **`gabriel.deduplicate`** combine embeddings with GPT adjudication to produce clean entity lists or fuzzy joins.
- **`gabriel.deidentify`** replaces PII with realistic stand-ins, respecting grouping columns and optionally reusing an existing mapping.
- **`gabriel.paraphrase`** and **`gabriel.whatever`** let you rewrite or completely customize prompts while retaining parallelization, retries, and logging.

### Discovery pipelines and helper utilities
- **`gabriel.seed`** generates diverse seed entities/personas, enforcing representation constraints before you collect more data.
- **`gabriel.ideate`** brainstorms hundreds of candidate hypotheses, then filters/ranks them (often chained with `gabriel.rank`).
- **`gabriel.debias`** regresses out unwanted signals by measuring confounds (via rate/codify) and stripping them from your primary measurement.
- **`gabriel.load`** builds spreadsheets from folders of media so every downstream task can attach images or audio by file path.
- **`gabriel.whatever`** also supports `web_search=True`, letting GPT gather fresh evidence before you rate or extract against it.

## Detailed usage

The tutorial notebook shows full projects end-to-end; the summaries below serve as a quick reference to the knobs each helper exposes.

### Rating (`gabriel.rate` / `Rate`)
- Provide a DataFrame, the column to evaluate, and an attribute‚Üídefinition mapping.
- Supports batching (`n_parallels`), multiple passes (`n_runs`), modality-specific prompts (`modality`), and optional reasoning traces (`reasoning_effort`, `reasoning_summary`).
- Saves intermediate CSVs (`file_name`, default `ratings.csv`) under `save_dir` alongside raw responses.

### Ranking (`gabriel.rank` / `Rank`)
- Runs pairwise tournaments with Elo-style updates to capture fine-grained differences.
- Configure `n_rounds`, `matches_per_round`, `learning_rate`, and `recursive=True` to iteratively refine the leaderboard.
- Use `initial_rating_pass` or `initial_rating_field` to seed scores from a prior `rate` run when helpful.

### Classification (`gabriel.classify` / `Classify`)
- Map label names to definitions; results include per-label probabilities and consensus columns.
- Optional differentiation mode asks the model to contrast close labels for richer rationales.
- Works well for multimodal tagging when paired with `modality="image"`/`"audio"`.

### Extraction (`gabriel.extract` / `Extract`)
- Define attributes alongside descriptions of the desired outputs; optional `types` enforce schemas (e.g. `{ "year": "int" }`).
- Handles JSON mode and nested schemas for complex cards (e.g. product + specs + price).
- Combine with `gabriel.load` to attach file paths for multimodal product cards.

### Filtering and coding (`gabriel.filter`, `gabriel.codify`, `gabriel.view`)
- `filter` screens huge candidate lists with a natural-language condition; tune `entities_per_call`, `threshold`, and `shuffle` to balance recall vs. throughput.
- `codify` highlights snippets that match qualitative codes and pairs nicely with `view` for UI-based audits.
- `gabriel.view` renders interactive tables/sliders over the saved outputs so you can inspect ratings, classifications, or passage coding runs.

### Discovery and ideation (`gabriel.discover`, `gabriel.bucket`, `gabriel.compare`, `gabriel.seed`, `gabriel.ideate`)
- `discover` chains compare ‚Üí bucket ‚Üí classify to surface discriminating features across two classes of data.
- `bucket` groups long lists of entities or terms into emergent taxonomies you can feed back into classification or ranking.
- `compare` writes bullet-point similarities/differences for paired entries (e.g. draft A vs. draft B).
- `seed` enforces distributional constraints when generating starter personas/entities for follow-on measurement.
- `ideate` produces many candidate theories/ideas, then filters/ranks them‚Äîgreat for brainstorming research hypotheses before measurement.

### Cleaning and matching (`gabriel.merge`, `gabriel.deduplicate`)
- Combine embeddings with GPT adjudication to produce clean entity lists or fuzzy joins.
- Control chunk sizes, timeout behavior, and auto-matching thresholds; outputs include mapping columns you can feed to downstream analyses.

### Privacy, rewriting, and bias correction (`gabriel.deidentify`, `gabriel.paraphrase`, `gabriel.debias`)
- `deidentify` replaces PII with realistic stand-ins, respecting grouping columns and optionally reusing an existing mapping.
- `paraphrase` rewrites passages under strict guidance (e.g. remove brand mentions) with optional recursive validation loops.
- `debias` regresses out unwanted signals by measuring confounds (via rate/codify) and stripping them from your primary measurement.

### Loading media and custom prompts (`gabriel.load`, `gabriel.whatever`)
- `load` walks a folder of text/image/audio files and produces a spreadsheet with identifiers + file paths so every downstream task can attach those modalities.
- `whatever` accepts fully custom prompts, attachments, and advanced flags (`json_mode`, `web_search`, `response_fn`) while reusing retries, parallelism, and checkpointing.

## Multimodal data and web search

All measurement helpers accept a `modality` argument (`text`, `entity`, `image`, `audio`, or `web`). When working with folders of media, run `gabriel.load` first to expand files into rows with clean IDs. Set `web_search=True` (plus optional domain/location filters) on `gabriel.whatever` or pass `modality="web"` to `gabriel.rate`/`gabriel.extract` when you want GPT to gather the relevant context before answering. The same batching, retries, and checkpointing apply regardless of modality.

## Custom prompts and model routing

Tweak any task by:

- Passing extra instructions via `additional_instructions` (appended to our prompt templates), or supplying your own Jinja template with `template_path` as long as it uses the same variable names.
- Using `gabriel.whatever` for fully custom prompts while keeping automated retries, rate-limit handling, and persistent logging.
- Supplying a custom `response_fn` if you want to call a different API; GABRIEL will feed prompts/attachments through your callable and continue with the same parsing + saving pipeline.

## Saving, logging, and resuming

Each run expands `save_dir` (tilde and environment variables supported), writes your structured output (`file_name` CSV/Parquet), and saves raw model payloads under `responses/` together with metadata so you can audit later. Leave `reset_files=False` (default) to resume partially completed runs; delete the folder or pass `reset_files=True` to start fresh. `gabriel.view` reads these outputs to provide a lightweight UI for spot checks.

## Development and testing

Install development extras and run tests:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest
```

Tests rely on the built-in dummy responses, so no API key is necessary. Linting and type checks (`ruff`, `mypy`) are also included in the dev extras.
